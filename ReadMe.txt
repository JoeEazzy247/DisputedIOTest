General Note:

Enclosed is a page object model project with automted test for blazor Url https://blazor.radzen.com/
	1. Pages Folder contains the following Pages: A. HomePage.js 
						      B. DashBoardPage.js
						      C. ImagePage.js
						      D. NotificationPage.js
						      All pages contains element properties and methods or functions

	2. Test folder consist of 'DisputedIOTest' suite were all my automated test resides. The test is taken from DisputedIO Test Plan (Excel document)

	3. TestModule folder consist of 'AutomatedProject' suite demonstrating unit test just to get a feel for how to use Test Cafe

	4. Package.json consist of my json info. i.e as mentioned above, each script name can be utilied for testrun from the terminal window

Overall i think i have enjoyed a couple of hours automating with TestCafe experiencing how resourcefull Tescafe can be. everything thing I did here
i believe is pretty basic and can be improved a lot however it did the job for me knowing it is my first attempt automating with testcafe.


Finally: There is no test context implementation for running on cloud. 

Thank you for the opportunity

Joseph
